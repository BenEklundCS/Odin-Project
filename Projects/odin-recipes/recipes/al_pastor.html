                <li>Heat a dry skillet over medium heat and toast the dried chilies for about 1-2 minutes until they become fragrant.</li>
                <li>Place the toasted chilies in a bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them soak for about 15-20 minutes until they soften.</li>

                <li>Blend until you have a smooth paste. You may need to add a little water if it's too thick.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                <li>Pour the marinade over the pork and toss to coat the meat thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

                <li>Grill the pork for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until it's cooked through and has a nice char.</li>
                <li>While grilling, you can also place the pineapple slices on the grill for a minute or two on each side until they have grill marks.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
